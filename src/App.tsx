          I apologize in advance, I'm no story writer, so forgive me for the
          scanty nature of the letter. I just wrote it as things came to my
          head.

          If I had written this note on paper and you ended up going for the
          digital version, me and you would have issues.
          <br />
          <br />
          I donâ€™t know where to start from, but I know what to say.
          <br />
          <br />
          Iâ€™ve told you I like you, so thatâ€™s not new, but I am about to wow
          your mind (donâ€™t expect any wowing because Iâ€™m just kidding ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚).
          <br />
          <br />I would love to make this clear once again{" "}
          <span className="text-red-700 capitalize font-bold">
            (most likely the last time as I said I donâ€™t want to keep talking
            about it)
          </span>
          . Iâ€™m not looking forward to a one-time thing with you, so I donâ€™t
          mind taking things slow and getting to know you better. Sorry for
          being touchy, sorry for doing too much in that area (I apologize, my
          boss). Iâ€™ll try as much as possible to be less touchy until whenever
          we both agree itâ€™s fine.
          <br />
          <br />
          One thing that caught my eye the day I saw you was your hair tie or
          scarf ðŸ˜‚, it looked really cute and modest (Iâ€™m not all for exposing
          your body blah blah blah to be attractive).
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-left space-y-3 pl-4">
            <li className="flex items-start">
              <span className="mr-2 text-purple-700">â€¢</span>
              <span>
                I like it when you smile, it makes me happy inside even though I
                wonâ€™t show it ðŸŒš.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li className="flex items-start">
              <span className="mr-2 text-purple-700">â€¢</span>
              <span>
                I like the way we text as well, itâ€™s really hard to find someone
                that matches your energy. Nothing feels forced. Oh, and yes, you
                said you play CODM â€” such a turn on ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ (I hope youâ€™re not a
                bot though ðŸŒš).
              </span>
            </li>
            <li className="flex items-start">
              <span className="mr-2 text-purple-700">â€¢</span>
              <span>
                I like you for being a yapper, like girl, donâ€™t stop telling me
                stuff, especially the things you wouldnâ€™t confide in anyone else
                ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜‚.
              </span>
            </li>
            <li className="flex items-start">
              <span className="mr-2 text-purple-700">â€¢</span>
              <span>
                I also like the fact that youâ€™re caring. I mean, see Doris being
                that girl, but you still went the extra mile for her (ps: if I
                see you with that girl or trying to help by any chance, you
                might not hear from me again ðŸ˜…).
              </span>
            </li>
            <li className="flex items-start">
              <span className="mr-2 text-purple-700">â€¢</span>
              <span>
                I like the fact that youâ€™ve been honest so far about what you
                want, and I respect your decision. I understand why youâ€™re doing
                so. No one wants to make the same mistake twice or get hurt real
                bad.
              </span>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          I want us to be good friends, dead the idea of me wanting to sleep
          with you, and move on because itâ€™s really not hard for me to ask you
          directly if thatâ€™s all I wanted (that might sound cocky, but yeah, Iâ€™m
          direct like that).
          <br />
          <br />
          Sorry for the times Iâ€™ve offended you as well, and thank you for not
          running away and keeping up with my drama, girl.
          <br />
          <br />
          On the side, donâ€™t worry, everything will be fine eventually. The life
          you want (youâ€™re yet to tell me though), stability in finances (very
          important), good grades (keep reading your books, nothing comes
          easyâ€”thatâ€™s why there are limited seats in the library but not in
          class), healthy skin & a glow-up (ps: school & glow donâ€™t go well)
          will come. Just hang in there, keep doing your stuff, and Iâ€™m sure
          things will get better as long as you work towards them.
