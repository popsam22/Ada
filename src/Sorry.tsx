          I am back again, I hope we're still on track. It's 1:09am in the
          morning and I'm trying to work but you just crossed my mind. I got you
          the bell pepper (I just checked Google and it's spelled "bell" ðŸ˜…).
          <br />
          <br />
          Uhm, I feel a communication gap, and I want to believe you understand
          what I'm talking about. I know work can be tiring and exhausting, but
          this gap wasn't there earlier on and you're still working, lol. (If I
          did anything wrong, please let me know.) I still feel the same way
          about you as I've always feltâ€”always happy when I get to spend time
          with you, wanting to see your face (that random feel came yesterday,
          but you're supposedly busy ðŸ™„ðŸ™„).
          <br />
          <br />
          There are times we're together, and I really want to hug you because I
          don't get to think about anything else during that period. But most
          times, you tell me "NO," and it hurts me because you don't know what
          it could've done at that point. I am not perfect, but I'm trying to be
          a better person, so let me know what you don't likeâ€”I'm open to
          working on it.
          <br />
          <br />I know what I want, and I want this. I'm not unsure, but
          honestly, I don't know what you want because you never told me (it'd
          help if you did). I just wanted to be clear on this: "I STILL VERY
          MUCH DO LIKE YOU" and I want to hear what you have in mind so we know
          where to go from here. Thank you, Ma.
